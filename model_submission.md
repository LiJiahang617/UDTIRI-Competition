各位参赛队伍，大家好：
按照比赛的日程安排，大家应该已经完成了模型的搭建以及训练，并且已经将模型训练好的权重以及所有项目文件打包成docker镜像了。
经过实验室讨论决定，参赛队伍请将docker镜像提交至docker-hub上，供我们拉取检查。
各组最终说明邮件提交截止日期：2022.11.23   23：59

各位队伍所需提交文件：
0.写清docker镜像的地址，仓库名称等具体信息，将说明发送至报名邮箱，并附一份项目模型说明文件（见第2点）以供能我们拉取对应镜像与评测。（发送至邮箱才视为成功提交结果，我们只会对收到地址以及对应信息的队伍进行拉取镜像与评估）。
1.完整的docker镜像，包括打包好的权重以及项目文件，评估脚本（使用COCOtools编写，要求能给定权重直接输出模型bbox与seg的coco指标）全部上传至dockerhub。
2.项目以及模型的说明文件（网络名称，原型，大致的构建思路）以及相关脚本程序的使用说明，一并放入docker镜像中。

对于比赛后续评测的说明：
1.截至2022.11.23 23：59 之前提交说明到邮箱的队伍视为结果提交成功，参与最终评测。迟交或者未按规定提交文件的，我们在检查后有权直接取消参赛资格。
2.由于工作量较大，我们将在月底左右公布最后的结果，并且对最终获奖的名单进行公示，预计到时候会有进一步相关通知，github仓库会随时更新通知，请大家继续关注。
3.如RAIL在测试参赛队伍项目时遇到问题，会与对应队伍联系，请最近留意邮箱（我们会通过参赛队伍所留联系方式与队伍联系）。
4.所有模型我们会保证隐私，不会公开，请各位放心。
5.后续的获奖队伍与奖金发放最终方式会在月底公布，请耐心等待。

                                                                                         Hello, participating teams:
According to the schedule of the competition, everyone should have completed the building and training of the model, and packaged the trained weights of the model and all project files into a docker image.
After discussion and decision in the laboratory, the participating teams should submit the docker image to docker-hub for us to pull and check.
Deadline for email submission of final instructions for each group: 2022.11.23 23:59

All teams need to submit documents:
0. Write down the specific information such as the address of the docker image, the warehouse name, etc., and send the description to the registration mailbox, and attach a project model description file (see point 2) so that we can pull the corresponding image and evaluate it. (Sent to the mailbox is considered a successful submission result, and we will only pull the mirror image and evaluate the team that received the address and corresponding information).
1. The complete docker image, including the packaged weights and project files, and the evaluation script (written using COCOtools, which requires the given weight to directly output the coco indicators of the model bbox and seg) are all uploaded to dockerhub.
2. Project and model description files (network name, prototype, general construction idea) and related script instructions are put into the docker image together.

Instructions for the follow-up evaluation of the competition:
1. Teams that submit instructions to their mailboxes before 23:59 on November 23, 2022 will be deemed successful and will participate in the final evaluation. For those who submit documents late or fail to submit according to the regulations, we have the right to disqualify the competition directly after inspection.
2. Due to the heavy workload, we will announce the final results around the end of the month, and publicize the final list of winners. It is expected that there will be further relevant notices at that time, and the github warehouse will update the notices at any time. Please continue to pay attention.
3. If RAIL encounters problems when testing the participating team’s project, it will contact the corresponding team. Please pay attention to the mailbox recently (we will contact the team through the contact information left by the participating team).
4. We will guarantee the privacy of all models and will not make them public, please rest assured.
5. The final method of award-winning teams and bonus distribution will be announced at the end of the month, please wait patiently.
                                                                                         Tongji RAIL
